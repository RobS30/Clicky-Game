<h1>Clicky Game</h1>

<h2>How to play</h2>
The game will render 8 different images of dogs.  Each time an image is clicked on for the first time, the player's score increases by one.  However, if the same image is clicked on more than once, then the player's score is reset to 0 and the game restarts.  To make the game more challenging, the cards shuffle into a random order each time an image is clicked.
